# Lock Master
Customize the iOS Locking Experience!

**Note: This will NOT work on "semi-jailbreaks" such as Seratonin.** It needs the backboardd to be resigned. Please do not create github issues asking me to add support for them, your issue will be deleted.

## Features
- Custom lock animations
- Custom lock sound
    - Supported formats: `.m4a`, `.mp3`, `.wav`

## Coming Soon
- Turning on animations
- More customization of animation events

## Credits
- This tweak is a fork of both [LockAnim](https://github.com/julioverne/LockAnim) and [DisintegrateLock](https://github.com/p0358/DisintegrateLock/tree/master) (Moreso DisintegrateLock).
